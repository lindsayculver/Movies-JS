# _Movies_

##### This app tells the user the price of a movie ticket based on several criteria: time of day, age, and whether it's a new release.

## Description

_The goal of this app was to create a website where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie and their age. The webpage let's the user know how much their movie ticket will cost, based on those three factors. It considers the fact that non-"first-release" movies, matinee and senior tickets tend to be cheaper than the regular priced tickets_
